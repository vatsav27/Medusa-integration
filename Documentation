              **Task 1 : Integrate and Run Medusa locally **
Step 1:
For this task we need prerequisites.
They are: 
1.	Nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer
2.	PostgreSQL : https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
3.	Git : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

•	We can check the installation of them using the commands 
           "node -v, npm -v, git --version"
Step 2 :
•	This step is the installation of the “medusa cli”. We use the command –
"npm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli ".
•	This step installs the medusa CLI.
•	Check medusa CLI using the command – 
"medusa –version".

Step 3:
•	This step is the installation of the Medusa backend. We use the command --medusa new my-medusa-app.
•	At the end of the setup we will be asked about the database creation. Here we have to select the change credentials and give our inputs for the PostgreSQL database.
•	Once the setup is over the directory of Medusa will be created.
•	We have to use the command 
"cd my-medusa-app" (i.e. going inside the directory)

Step 4:
•	Then we should go with the command 
"npm run seed" to add sample seed data to our database.

Step 5:
•	Then we should give the command that redirects our browser to the page http://localhost:7001/login 
The command is "medusa develop".

Step 6:
•	Medusa is now accessible through its login page. We can give email and password to log into it.
